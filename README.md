# youtube-clone:

 This project "youtube clone" was assigned to me by codeclause web development team as a task in web development internship.
 The goal of this project is to design a web page that is exactly same as the frontend page of YouTube app which users see when
 they open the YouTube application.

 To develop the project i use the following frontend technologies namely HTML and CSS. While designing the youtube clone app i
 learnt alot of skills and gained confidence to develop more projects like this.And also, i would like to contribute my skills to 
 develop some more projects and enhance my skills both in frontend and backend technologies.
 
 Overall, the experience of working on the YouTube_clone_app project was immensely educational and fulfilling. It allowed me to 
 deepen my knowledge of frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to CodeClause organization and for the knowledge and skills I gained during this internship.
 The YouTube_clone_app project not only enhanced my understanding of web development but also reinforced the importance of creating practical, 
 interactive, and educational tools for aspiring coders.
